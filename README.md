## About

Heyo! I'm Nicolas, a 32 y/o self taught developer building rad stuff in NYC.

I love React, (Next.js specifically) but I'm dangerously skilled across the entire stack.
I'm super passionate about Dev Rel & DX. I've spent quite a bit of my professional time in the realms of auth, payments and analytics.
Recently I've taken interest in Web3/decentralized technologies and predictive AI. Currently focused on improving my Solidity skills.
