## About

Heyo! I'm Nicolas, a 31 y/o self taught developer based in NYC.

I'm super passionate about building developer tools:
<br />
<em>Libraries, CLIs, extensions, plugins and starter templates.</em>

Recently I've taken interest in patterns, workspaces in monorepos and computing at the edge. 
<br />
When I'm not coding, I'm boxing, playing destiny, or perfecting my signature iced matcha.
